## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am 15 years old and I have been traveling with a passion for software development since 2020 🚀
I live in Antalya and I am a student at Hacı Melike Mehmet Bileydi Anatolian High School 🎓
My interest in coding started as a hobby and soon turned into a lifestyle.

🔹 I actively use many languages such as Python, Java, C#, C++, Rust.
🔹 I develop web, mobile and desktop applications; I focus on game programming, artificial intelligence 🤖 and generative AI 🧠.
🔹 I design my own chatbots and productive artificial intelligence systems, constantly learning new technologies 📚

For me, software is not just about writing code, but about generating ideas, solving problems and shaping the future 💡
Every project is a new adventure, every line of code is one step further 💻✨
My goal is to add value to people with technology and produce inspiring work.
I am always open to learning new information and sharing what I learn 🙌
