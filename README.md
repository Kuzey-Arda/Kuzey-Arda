## 👨‍💻 About me
I am 15 years old. I live in Antalya. I am a student at Hacı Malike Mehmet Bileydi Anatolian High School and I am also a software developer. 🎓

Since 2020, I have been interested in software and I am improving myself more and more every day in this field 🚀
My interest in coding started as a hobby and soon turned into a lifestyle.

🔹 I know many languages such as Python, Java, C#, C++, C, Rust and Assembly. I actively use Java, C# and Python languages.
🔹 I develop web, mobile and desktop applications; I focus on game programming, artificial intelligence 🤖 and generative artificial intelligence 🧠.
🔹 I design my own chatbots and generative artificial intelligence systems, constantly learning new technologies 📚
🔹 I write and develop my own software language.

For me, developing software is not only writing code, but also generating ideas, solving problems and shaping the future💡
Every project is a new adventure, every line of code is one step further 💻✨
My goal is to add value to people with technology and produce inspiring work.
I am always open to learning new information and sharing what I have learned 🙌
